</details>

## Current configuration

- macOS: Big Sur 11.2.3
- OpenCore: 0.6.8

## Installation

<details>
<summary><strong>Create the USB</strong></summary>
</br>

Follow the [guide on the OpenCore documentation](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/) to create a USB for installation. Choose the operating system you use to create the USB and proceed with the guide. At the end of the Create USB section, OpenCore will ask us to do additional configurations. We don't need to do any of that because the `EFI` folder in this repository provides all necessary configurations we need for installation on Dell Latitude E7470.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Boot and Install macOS</strong></summary>
</br>

- Plug in the USB we created to your Dell computer
- Press the Power button to turn on our computer (if you used the Dell to create the USB, shutdown the computer first)
- Wait and we will see the Apple icon on a black screen with a progress bar at the bottom
- Then, we will see a menu with four options. Make sure select `Disk Utility` to partition your disk appropriately and format the partition for installing macOS into `APFS`. If you are dual booting with other operating systems, an easier way would be to partition the drive beforehand as some formats like NTFS are readonly on macOS.
- Follow the installation steps and configure the preferences to your liking
- Log in to macOS and enjoy

## Post Installation

<details>
<summary><strong>Booting without USB</strong></summary>
</br>

You need to plug in the installation USB created previously everytime you start macOS after shutdown. If you want to boot without the USB, follow [this guide by OpenCore](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/oc2hdd.html#grabbing-opencore-off-the-usb).

<details>
<summary><strong>Update Instructions</strong></summary>
</br>

- To Update to Big Sur from Catalina, just replace the previous Catalina EFI(only if you're using it from my repo) with this one and update normally.

- To update from an older version of EFI to the current one, download this repository and replace your EFI folder with this one. Make sure you use your own SMBIOS, the included one is only for reference.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Fixing iServices</strong></summary>
</br>

- In order to get Apple Services like App Store working, you need to generate your own SMBIOS(The included one is only for reference).
- Use [this guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/misc/msr-lock.html#what-is-cfg-lock) to unlock MSR register and enable native Power management as it's different for every Boards.
